# Hiring: Postdoctoral Fellow

The [National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)](http://www.nimh.nih.gov) is the largest funder of research on mental disorders in the world, with a current budget of over $1.6B per year. Our mission is to transform the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses through basic and clinical research, paving the way for prevention, recovery, and cure. The postdoctoral community at the NIH is large (approximately 4,000) strong and vibrant. Trainees come from across the U.S. and around the world. [Salary](https://www.training.nih.gov/postdoctoral_irta_stipend_ranges) for this position is defined by type of training and years of experience. [Benefits](https://www.training.nih.gov/programs/postdoc_irp) include health insurance for the trainee and his/her family, and support for coursework related to the trainee’s research and travel to meetings is often available.

At the NIMH’s Mood, Brain, and Development Unit, our central focus is understanding mood and its disorders, particularly in adolescents. We are interested in the relationship between reward processing, mood, and depression \(you can find our current thoughts [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.04.975136v1)\), as well as understanding the effects of mood states. We approach these questions with a broad range of techniques, benefitting from the unique scientific environment and resources that the NIH offers, as well as our collaborations around the world. In particular, we use longitudinal imaging protocols in fMRI and MEG at three different time scales, generative bayesian modeling, rapid development and deployment of tasks and measures via Pavlovia and Mechanical Turk. Additionally, we’ve developed a closed-loop, parametric, mood-manipulation task that produces strong changes in mood both in fMRI and over the internet (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/815944v1). We are a team that works closely together, has many regular science and social meetings and collaborates extensively with others in and out of NIH.
